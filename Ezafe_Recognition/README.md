In Persian, we pronounce 'e' after words that have a specific position tag(but there are some exceptions! e.g., the words which end with 'v' never get 'e'). If we pronounce 'e' after the word then ezafe_tag is equal to 1. o.w ezafe_tag is equal to 0. Our goal is to predict that wheater a word in a sentence ends with 'e' or not.
